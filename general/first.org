This took a while to setup. 

For some reason I was really set on using org files to statically generate this site. 
Then I looked through a lot of different org file static site generators. 
Finally landed on org-pages, but then forked it, heavily modified it and removed lots of extras.


At least I know emacs lisp now. (Self High Five!)


This was way too complicated.
